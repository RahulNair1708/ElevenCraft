# ElevenCraft: Find your Best XI

# Project Overview
In this end-to-end data analytics project, I utilized data from the T20 Cricket World Cup (2022) to identify the best XI players.
The project combines web scraping, data transformation, and visualization techniques to extract actionable insights and create an interactive dashboard.

# Key Features
1) Web Scraping:
    Used Bright Data for robust web scraping to collect data from ESPNcricinfo.
    Extracted detailed player performance statistics such as batting averages, bowling economy, strike rates, and fielding records.

2) Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
    Implemented using Python's pandas library.
    Removed inconsistencies, handled missing data, and optimized the dataset for further analysis.
    Engineered new features like performance scores and efficiency ratings for better team selection insights.

3) Insights and Analytics:
    Analyzed player data to determine optimal combinations of batting, bowling, and all-rounder roles.
    Used statistical metrics such as strike rates, economy rates, and match impact to select players.

4) Visualization:
    Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights, including:
        Best XI team composition.
        Player rankings and individual contributions.
        Performance comparisons across metrics like strike rate and bowling economy.
